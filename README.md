# simple_colorGame
**DISCLAIMER**: This is just a simple color game created using WindowsFormsApp. I got bored so I decided to do this.

Using a WinForms app, I created a simple color game with basic UI, mechanics, and functionalities similar to how it is traditionally played.

Color games are one of the most popular games played among circus visitors in the Philippines. This is usually seen at what Filipinos call the "Perya," celebrated during local town festivals.

**MECHANICS:**
Like the original game, three dice with different colors on each side are rolled or shuffled. Players can place bets on the color they think will appear. They can choose between White, Yellow, Pink, Green, Blue, and Red. If the color they bet on shows up on any of the dice, they win, and their bet is doubled.

**HOW TO PLAY:**
This game operates similarly to the traditional version. Instead of pulling a string to roll the dice, the program randomizes the dice. You can play the game using a combination of digital UI and traditional betting. Simply provide a mat to place bets on specific colors, and let the program randomize the winning colors.
